    "Mix 1 cup semi-sweet and 1 cup milk chocolate chips in a microwavable bowl and melt in the microwave using 30 second intervals",
    "Grease pan generously with shortening (you can use the daisy pan I used or cupcake liners to get that crinkled effect around the edges)Fill cavities up 1/3 of the way with the melted chocolate and place in freezer to chill for about 5 minutes",
    "Prepare peanut butter filling by first melting peanut butter and butter together for about 20 seconds in the microwave",
    "Mix melted peanut butter and butter with sugar and graham cracker crumbs. I had left my mixer at home so I just used my hands for this part (if the filling ends up being too crumbly, try adding more melted butter and peanut butter)",
    "Remove pan from freezer and spoon peanut butter mixture onto each chocolate layer, making sure not to fill it up to the edges so that your top layer of chocolate can drip down and form the sides",
    "Mix and melt remaining chocolate chips and pour over the peanut butter so that it fills in the gaps on the sides and is even on top",
    "Refrigerate for about 30 minutes before serving/gorging"
